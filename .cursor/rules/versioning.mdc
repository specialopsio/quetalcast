# Documentation Upkeep

After **every** change of impact — features, fixes, hardening, behavior changes — update all relevant docs **in the same commit or immediately after**. Do not wait to be asked.

- **Changelog** (`src/lib/changelog.ts`) — always add entries. Features go in `items`, bug fixes and minor improvements go in `fixes`.
- **README** (`README.md`) — update features, setup, env vars, architecture, security sections as needed.
- **Docs** (`src/pages/docs/`) — update Broadcaster, Receiver, Integrations pages when their described behavior changes.

Do not leave docs stale when you change behavior they describe. When in doubt, update.

# Version Numbering

This project uses **Semantic Versioning** (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). We are in **prerelease** (0.x.x) until the product is considered ready for 1.0. The current version is in `VERSION` and `package.json`.

## When to Bump

| Bump | When | Examples |
|------|------|----------|
| **PATCH** (0.5.0 → 0.5.1) | Bug fixes, hardening, stability improvements, tiny UI tweaks — no new user-facing features | Fix crash, fix typo, adjust button size, server hardening, CORS fix |
| **MINOR** (0.5.0 → 0.6.0) | New user-facing features or significant enhancements | New effect, new integration, new UI section, new workflow |
| **MAJOR** (0.x.x → 1.0.0) | Breaking changes, API changes, removal of features. Reserved for when prerelease ends. | Remove deprecated API, change auth flow |

Not every commit needs a version bump. Group related changes into a single bump. A series of rapid bug fixes can share one PATCH. But don't let unversioned changes accumulate — if the change is meaningful enough for the changelog, it should have a version.

## Files to Update

1. **VERSION** — single line with version (e.g. `0.5.1`)
2. **package.json** — `"version": "0.5.1"`
3. **src/lib/changelog.ts** — add a new entry for the release with date and items/fixes

## Changelog Format

Add entries to `CHANGELOG` in `src/lib/changelog.ts`. Each entry has:
- `date`: ISO date string (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `version`: version string (required)
- `items`: array of features and enhancements
- `fixes`: optional array of bug fixes, hardening, and minor improvements

Keep entries concise. One line per change. No commit hashes. Add to `fixes` for anything that isn't a new feature — bug fixes, stability improvements, internal hardening, CORS fixes, etc. A version can have only `fixes` and an empty `items` array if there are no new features.
