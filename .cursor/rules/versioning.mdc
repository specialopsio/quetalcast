# Documentation Upkeep

After **every** change of impact — features, fixes, hardening, behavior changes — update all relevant docs **in the same commit or immediately after**. Do not wait to be asked.

- **Changelog** (`src/lib/changelog.ts`) — always add entries. Features go in `items`, bug fixes and minor improvements go in `fixes`.
- **README** (`README.md`) — update features, setup, env vars, architecture, security sections as needed.
- **Docs** (`src/pages/docs/`) — update Broadcaster, Receiver, Integrations pages when their described behavior changes.

Do not leave docs stale when you change behavior they describe. When in doubt, update.

# Version Numbering

This project uses **Semantic Versioning** (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). We are in **prerelease** (0.x.x) until the product is considered ready for 1.0. Update both `VERSION` and `package.json` version when releasing.

## When to Bump

| Bump | When | Examples |
|------|------|----------|
| **PATCH** (0.9.0 → 0.9.1) | Bug fixes, typos, tiny UI tweaks, no new features | Fix crash, fix typo, adjust button size |
| **MINOR** (0.9.0 → 0.10.0) | New features, backward compatible | New effect, new integration, new UI section |
| **MAJOR** (0.9.0 → 1.0.0) | Breaking changes, API changes, removal of features. Reserve for when prerelease ends. | Remove deprecated API, change auth flow |

## Files to Update

1. **VERSION** — single line with version (e.g. `0.9.1`)
2. **package.json** — `"version": "0.9.1"`
3. **src/lib/changelog.ts** — add a new entry for the release with date and items

## Changelog Format

Add entries to `CHANGELOG` in `src/lib/changelog.ts`. Each entry has:
- `date`: ISO date string (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `version`: version string (required)
- `items`: array of features and enhancements
- `fixes`: optional array of bug fixes, hardening, and minor improvements

Keep entries concise. One line per change. No commit hashes. Add to `fixes` for anything that isn't a new feature — bug fixes, stability improvements, internal hardening, CORS fixes, etc.
